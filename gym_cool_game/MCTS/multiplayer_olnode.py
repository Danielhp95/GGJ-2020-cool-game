class MultiplayerOpenLoopNode:
    """
        An Open-loop approach keeps only one state representation at the root node of the game tree being computed by MCTS, and each of the edges represent an action. As the game tree is being traversed, the actions stored in the nodes being traversed are used as input to the model of the game. Thus the initial state stored at the root of the tree changes according to the actions selected during the game tree traversal. Once an MCTS iteration is over, this stated modified during the tree traversal is discarded, and a new clone of the state of the root node is created. Furthermore, we don't store the intermediate states obtained during the traversal. This means that we are esentially throwing away the computation performed by the model as soon as we don't need it.


        Node of a game tree. A tree is a connected acyclic graph.
        Note: self.wins is from the perspective of playerJustMoved.
